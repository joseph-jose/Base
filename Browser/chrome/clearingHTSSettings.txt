Behaviour you have notices is implemented by a browser. This a new(ish) feature to increase security. First version of Chrome to support it was 4.02.211.  Chrome is replacing http to https for a number of sites and there is a way to change/clear the sites. 

Here is what I have found on the internet about clearing them on Chrome.

Clearing HSTS Settings on Chrome
1.    Close all tabs in Chrome.
2.    Type “chrome://net-internals/#hsts” into your address bar to access the Network Internals Page.
3.    In the “Query Domain” field, type your domain name and click OK, this will check to see the HSTS settings for your domain.
4.    If HSTS is enable, type your domain name in the “Delete Domain” field and click OK.
5.    Query your domain again, the results should say “not found.”
